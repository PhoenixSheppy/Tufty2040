# Tufty2040
A Compilation of the scripts and PSD's I wrote for my Tufty 2040.

# Discord.py / discord.psd
Looks like a Discord Profile, Edit to your liking!

# Spotify.py / spotify-tags.psd
Looks like a Spotify playlist, edit to your liking! (Note, requires a special font to look EXACTLY like Spotify, use another font if you don't have ["Proxima Nova"](https://freefontsfamily.com/proxima-nova-font-family-free-download/).)

# Badge.py
The default built-in badge script that comes with tufty. I did some minor modifications, probably won't use it much to be honest.
